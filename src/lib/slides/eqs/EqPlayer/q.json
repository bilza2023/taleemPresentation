This is an array of "slides" objects  .
please write me a function SetEqSlidesEndTime(slides)

    - this function loops over the slides and just get the slides with slide.type == "Eqs" or "eqs"
    
    - it then get into the eq slide "slide.items" and iterate over each "item.extra".

    - Each item.extra.endTime "should be set to the next item.extra.startTime". it measn that the last item ends where the next starts. 
    
    - The last item of eq slide will have item.extra.endTime =  slide.endTime.  (so that the last item ends when the slide ends).

    - the first item should always have its item.extra.startTime  = slide.startTime.  (so that the first item start when the slide start).
