I have 2 svelte components. 

Player : To run presentations along with sound.
PlayerNs : To run presentations WITHOUT sound (NS stands for no sound).

I will give the code for both of them. 
Please suggest do we need to keep 2 different components or just use 1 component "Player" and just internally take different action if there is no sound.

lets discuss first and ask questions before giving me code. so just discuss and leave code out.
